## Introduction

We provide an open source ecosystem centered around optimization and operations research.

The main project is the [Generic Allocator](./projects/net.splitcells.gel).
It is a Java framework providing modeling, analytic and solving capabilities regarding optimization problems.
A detailed introduction and documentation can be found [here](http://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/index.html).

An overview of the projects can be found [here](#networks-structure).

## Network's Structure

This project is meant to be part of a project cluster, with a certain filesystem structure in mind.
The cluster's filesystem consists of a folder containing repositories:

* [net.splitcells.network](http://splitcells.net):
  This repository integrates all projects, repositories and hosting services, that are part of the network.
  * [dem](./projects/net.splitcells.dem/README.md): Provides a standardized fundament for Java projects.
  * [gel](./projects/net.splitcells.gel/README.md): This framework delivers optimization capabilities.
  * [os.state.interface](./projects/net.splitcells.os.state.interface/README.md):
    The projects helps the user to organize and execute commands in the terminal via dependency injection.
  * [system](./projects/net.splitcells.system/README.md):
    Manages all integrated subprojects of the network.
    In particular, it can be used to build all integrated projects.
* **Related projects/repositories**:
  Related projects are located in repositories, which are at the same folder as the
  [net.splitcells.network](http://splitcells.net) project. 
  These projects are not inside this repository and are managed more independently.
  They may be managed by users with [OS state interface](./projects/net.splitcells.os.state.interface/README.md).
  It is recommended to not nest repositories.
