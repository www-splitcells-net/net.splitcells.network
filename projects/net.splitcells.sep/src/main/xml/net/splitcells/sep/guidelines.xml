    <paragraph>When one composes an allocation problem out of multiple ones,
        start with the sub problem,
        that allocates the most important resources first.
        This is especially the case, where the problem is modeled via a chain of allocations.
        There the first allocation table represents the demands or supplies of the second allocation table and so on.
        Thereby, the solver first allocates the most important resources first.
        The rating of the most important resources therefore gives the solver an immediate feedback
        regarding the possible allocations of secondary resources.
        When this is done the other way around by allocating secondary resources first,
        there is often the problem, that not enough feedback is present to allocate secondary resources in a useful way.
        Complying with constraints of secondary resources also can easily lead to local optima.
