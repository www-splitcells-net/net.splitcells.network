/**
 * <p>This interface provides a single point of entry for a Java module based on {@link Dem}.
 * It bundles all settings of a module at one place.</p>
 * <p>An instance of this interface describes the configuration of a program,
 * that can be executed via {@link Dem#serve(Class[])}.
 * Such a program provides its functionality via {@link Service}.
 * Therefore, {@link Cell} can also be viewed as a {@link Service} orchestration/configuration API.
 * Another goal of this API is to bundle all configurations of a Java module,
 * at one place and relying more on convention instead of configuration.</p>
 * <p>Classes implementing this method, are required to provide a public constructor without arguments.</p>
 * <p>New properties should not be added to this interface directly,
 * but should be added via the `Cell#accept` dynamically.
 * For one, we want to avoid bloating the Cell interface.
 * Furthermore,
 * a mechanism is required whereby value of some {@link Cell} properties is replaceable by the caller.
 * For instance,
 * a filesystem associated with a {@link Cell} is a file system view based on class resources by default in most cases.
 * When a developer wants to edit the data of the read only filesystem,
 * it would be efficient,
 * if the developer could edit the source files and test the edit without an application restart in the IDE.
 * Replacing the file system view based on class resources of a {@link Cell} with a file system view backed
 * by the source code, would make this possible.
 * In effect, properties associated with a {@link Cell} should be configured via dependency injection of {@link Dem},
 * when possible.</p>
 * <p>The word Module was not used, because java imports {@link java.lang.Module} by default,
 * which causes uncomfortableness in the IDE, when trying to adjust the default import.
 * The word unit was not used, in order to avoid confusion regarding unit tests.
 * The word cell was used, as it is also used in the project name ;)</p>
