/**
 * <p>No 2 instances of {@link FileSystem} should have the same class name
 * (i.e. multiple classes being named "FileSystem"),
 * because some decompilers have problems,
 * when such classes are referenced inside the same class.</p>
 * <p>When one works with {@link java.nio.file.Path} and {@link java.nio.file.Files} directly,
 * the current path (denoted as `./`) and the root path is always specific to the operation system and
 * the current process of the operation system.
 * This can lead to overly complex path handling, which is prone to errors.
 * Especially when one considers, how {@link java.nio.file.Path#resolve(Path)} works
 * with absolute paths.</p>
 * <p>The {@link FileSystem} tries to avoid this situation, by providing access to files,
 * that is not specific to the operation system and by only working with simplified paths.</p>
 * <p>The basic idea is, to only work with basic relative paths, that have no parent notations (= `../`).
 * Every time the user uses a path, the respective current folder or filesystem has to be specified.
 * This creates a situation, where for every purpose a file system is provided.
 * These are isolated from each other.
 * Thereby, different things like the config files or cache files can be handled via different file systems.
 * In the ideal case, the actual storage of these file is only configured and thereby interchangeable.</p>
 * <p>By default the methods do not provide any guarantee of being synchronous or asynchronous.
 * Implementations, may implement such methods in any way they like.
 * The reason for this is the fact, that asynchronous execution can be implemented using an synchronous API.</p>
 * <p>TODO Only allow a narrow subset of all possible paths by default.
 * Especially, don't allow pointing outside the file system via `../` and
 * discourage any usage of `..` and absolute paths.
 * </p>
