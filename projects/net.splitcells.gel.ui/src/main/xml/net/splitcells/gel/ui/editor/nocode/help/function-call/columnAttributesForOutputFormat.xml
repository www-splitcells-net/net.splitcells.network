        This function changes the format of the result table.
        Normally, every column of a solution stands for one attribute of the demands and supplies in the result table.
        Every row of a solution stands for an allocation with its demand and supply,
        where every column contains the allocation's value of the corresponding attribute.
        This function takes a list of attributes and replaces the columns meaning of the result table.
        In this case every column contains all allocations of a value combination of the given attributes.
