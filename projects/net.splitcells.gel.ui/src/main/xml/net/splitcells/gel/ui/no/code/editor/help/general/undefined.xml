        <title>Help Regarding Undefined Values</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>
        Undefined values are often represented by a <quote>?</quote>.
        These represent a location, where a value needs to be set,
        but where a value is not set yet.
        In its place, anything can be set, that can provide a value.
        These can be function calls, literals and variable references, for example.
