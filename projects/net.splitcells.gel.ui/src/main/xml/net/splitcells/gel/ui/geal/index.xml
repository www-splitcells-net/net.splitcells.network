        <title>The Generic Allocator Language - Geal</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>Geal is a minimal programming language for arbitrary program code
        with the main goal to describe programs for the Generic Allocator and therefore was named after it.
        The name Geal comes from using the first 2 letters for every word of the Generic Allocator,
        but Geal's full name is the Generic Allocator Language.
        Geal seem to also stand for
        <link url="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/geal">to congeal or stiffen</link>,
        which is quite fitting for a constraint language.
        Previously, the name Den was considered, which stands Discovery based Perspective Network,
        as this is a generic programming language,
        but the name was already used for an XML namespace in this project.
