# The Second Reprioritization
> New year new me?
## The Crisis Network Problem
> What is the issue?

[One year ago](2022-10-11-Reprioritization.md) I decided to add a game named Crisis Network to this project,
as a way to make this project more advertisable and to have a platform,
where I can create big optimization problems, for interesting projects in the future.

Ironically, I'm now in a situation, where the project takes too much time,
while not providing any usable software version for normal users.
I also noticed that some basics of the Generic Allocator were not in a good enough state for the game.
With the current game architecture the runtime deteriorates to such a degree,
that the game is not even fully runnable.
Furthermore, the deploy-ability of the project was questionable at best.

The Crisis network is still a useful project,
but is a **lot** more time intensive, than the school scheduling project,
which also would create a accessible program for end users.

## Reactivating The School Scheduling Project
> What is the solution?

Starting with September 2023,
I reactivated the [school scheduling project](https://github.com/www-splitcells-net/net.splitcells.network/issues/252) and
now I am proud,
that I have a usable GUI application waiting for a release.
At the same time, I lowered the effort put into the Crisis Network by a lot.

As the school scheduling project created some good results in 4 months,
I decided to extend the project by [cooperating with schools in order to get real world users for the software](https://github.com/www-splitcells-net/net.splitcells.network/issues/284).
The idea is to contact schools,
when the [school scheduling project](https://github.com/www-splitcells-net/net.splitcells.network/issues/252) is finished,
which should be the case by January 2024.
