# Splitcell's Project Files Standard

## Objectives
This project file structure standard describes a file structure,
that makes it easy to process projects via programs in order to render the project's documentation or
to synchronize multiple project storage sites, for example.
It tries to be compatible to as many public commonly used project file structures as possible.

Before this project existed, files, describing how a project should look like on the file structure level,
were scattered around.
This project moves all such files to one dedicated place and
thereby creates a standard, that is easier to understand, support and check.

There should be no hard dependencies except for Python 3 and the Unix shell,
in order to make as easy to use as possible for external users.
