See `project.render.py` for origin of this command.
This command is used in order to render a website based on the format of
`net.splitcells.website.server`.

One could just './bin/render.as.net.splitcells.website.to' itself,
but this command explicitly formalizes this standard.

This as an API for creating plugins for `splitcells.net`'s website server built
out of software, which have no explicit integration for said website server.
Integration is done by reading or writing to the same filesystem.

In order to create a plugin following needs to be done:
* Add and implement the following executable at a project: `./bin/render.as.net.splitcells.website.to`.
  It takes one argument containing a path.
  The command needs to write the plugin's part of the website to that path.
* Add the following to the website's build script:
  * `cd <plugin's path>`
  * `project.render.as.net.splitcells.website`

The target project layout is that of the "splitcells.net" website:
* The folders represent a namespace similar to package naming present in Java:
  The first folders represent the domains and sub domains.
  The following folders identify the project,
  that contains the files and folders of the project.
  The last folders represent the projects content structure.
  Any type of file type is allowed,
  but the focus lies on files for HTML websites,
  because the target project is deployment artifact for "spitcells.net".

TODO Make this an implementation of `project.render.py`,
that basically cd's into <--from-project> and then executes
`./bin/render.as.net.splitcells.website.to <--to-project>`.
