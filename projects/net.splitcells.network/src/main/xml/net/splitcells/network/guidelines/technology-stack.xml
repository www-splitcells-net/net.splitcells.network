        <title>Software Stack Guidelines</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>These guidelines describe, which technologies should be used for the project.
        There are 2 different software stacks in general:
        the primary stack provides the basis for the actual functionality and
        the secondary stack integrates the source code with the environment.
        The core stack represents the minimal software required to build and run this project.
        The extending stack extends the usefulness of the core stack and makes it more deployable.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        By default, the core stack is more restricted as the extending one,
        because the second stack needs to be compatible with first one.
        Also, one wants the core stack to be compatible to as many extending stacks as possible,
        which makes the software more portable.
        This requirement does not exist the other way around by default.

    <paragraph>
        Every software stack should be compatible to the

        <title>Recommended Default Software Stacks</title>
        <paragraph>The following software stacks are currently recommended:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>Shell (sh) is used to simply integrate software into the environment.
                In other words, shell scripts are used to call other programs.
            </item>
            <item>Python 3 is used for complex software integration into the environment.
                In other words, Python 3 is used instead of shell,
                when somewhat complex logic would be done in shell scripts or argument parsing needs to be done.
            </item>
            <item>Java and Maven for the main programs</item>
        </list>
