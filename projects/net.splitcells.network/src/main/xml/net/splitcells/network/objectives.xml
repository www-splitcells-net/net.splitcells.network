        <title>Abstract goals of the Network project</title>
        <paragraph>
            We provide an open source ecosystem centered around optimization and operations research,
            in order to achieve the following:
        </paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>Provide software and documentation to create and optimize problems based on a simple but powerful assignment model.</item>
            <item>
                Empower people to model and reason about complex systems,
                built out of interconnected optimization problems.
            </item>
            <item>Enable the user to understand the results given a solver and an optimization system.</item>
            <item>Develop new optimization algorithms.</item>
            <item>Provide compatibility between different optimization systems.</item>
        </list>
