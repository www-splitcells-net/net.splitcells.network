        <title>Descendant Combinator</title>
        <paragraph>Minimize usage of the descendant combinator,
            as handling of multiple descendant combinator matches can be tricky:
            in this project there is something like priority level classes used,
            in order to mark, which visual priority an element has for the user.
            This in turn controls mainly its colors,
            as elements with higher priority are drawn with more contrasted and brighter colors,
            in order to grab the user's attention more.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>So one might might be tempted to write rules like <quote>priority-level-1 div {...}</quote>.
            This leads to problems, when container elements with different priority levels are nested and
            therefore multiple descendant combinators with different priority levels match for one element.
            The first match according to the css file lines wins.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>If nesting of container elements with different priority levels can be avoided,
            descendant combinators are a good idea.
