        <title>Reason for These Guidelines</title>
        <paragraph>It's hard to get things right on the first try and to be honest on the second, third and so on.
            There is the inherit problem,
            that as humans we are not able to somewhat reliably determine as a group,
            if something is correct or better than something else,
            according to a given knowledge base.
            On average, we are not even able to determine, the best person for a job.
            Instead of living in denial, this is an attempt to cope with this situation.
