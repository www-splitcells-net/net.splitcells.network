        <title>Guiding The Reader</title>
        <paragraph>
            It is important, that the reader understands where a text is heading and
            to acknowledge, that every reader has its own context.
            It can be helpful to add a blockquote at the start of a chapter,
            in order to summaries the content of a chapter from a different perspective than the chapter's title.
            Creating dedicated articles for subgroups of readers like users or developers,
            can also achieve this goal as well.
