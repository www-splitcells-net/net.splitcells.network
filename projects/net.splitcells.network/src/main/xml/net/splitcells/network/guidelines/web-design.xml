        <title>Web Design Guidelines</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>
        The web design focuses on visualizing the structure of the data being presented.
        It clearly signals the importance of any given element for the current page and
        supports the reader to easily navigate the site to the desired destination.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        Things that are interactable and cause an action at the current page,
        should have inset shadows (in order to imitate a 3D button), be round and bold.
        Things that are used for navigation should have outset shadows (and therefore be flat),
        have corners and be bold.
        Any kind of interactable things should use sans serif fonts and
        non-interactive things should have serif fonts.
