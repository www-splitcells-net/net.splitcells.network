    <paragraph>
        The web design focuses on visualizing the structure of the data being presented.
        It clearly signals the importance of a given element for the current page and
        supports the reader to easily navigate the site to the desired destination.

        <title>The Design Of Buttons</title>
        <paragraph>
            Buttons for links to other pages and buttons for actions or links to local parts of the current page
            have different looks and feels.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Buttons for links to other pages have a flat look and feel.
            The button's text is centered or aligned to the left.
            The buttons themselves should always be aligned to the left.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Buttons for actions should look and feel a bit like real buttons.
            This is done via round corners, a distinct border and a background with linear gradients,
            that simulate a 3D effect.
            The text of action buttons is centered,
            while the action buttons themselves are aligned to the right.
