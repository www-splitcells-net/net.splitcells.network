        <title>XML Formatting</title>
        <paragraph>If a line of an XML document does not represent flowing
            text, there is no limit on the line length.
            Otherwise, a maximum length of 80 characters is preferred.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The star and end tag should have the same indention,
            so that formatters do not change their position during automatic formatting.
            Elements inside flowing text are allowed and
            do not require new line symbols between the start and end tag.
        </paragraph>
