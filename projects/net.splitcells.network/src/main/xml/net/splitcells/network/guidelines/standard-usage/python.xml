        <title>Python Guidelines</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>
        Python is used mainly for easily portable scripts and project commands.
        All Python scripts have to compatible to Python 3.12,
        so it is highly likely, that the operating system and especially Linux have the required package natively.
        This is especially important, in order to easily support bootstrapping the software build.
        No dependencies should be used in this case, if possible,
        as this avoids having a build step for this.
        If dependencies are required, consider Java instead.

    <paragraph>
        Use dedicated documentation files for detailed documentation.
        Help messages in CLI commands should only describe the minimal interface and
        show how more detailed information can be obtained.
