    <paragraph>Python 3 is used instead of shell,
        when otherwise somewhat complex logic would be done in shell scripts or argument parsing needs to be done.
        Minimize the number of templates inside a Python script,
        in order to simplify the code.
        In the ideal case, there is only one.
        Such an ideal Python script is basically like a simple shell script,
        where all arguments are passed implicitly as environment variables,
        but argument parsing is done explicitly via program arguments.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        Use dedicated documentation files for detailed documentation.
        Help messages in CLI commands should only describe the minimal interface and
        show how more detailed information can be obtained.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        Python code should adhere to <link url="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008">PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code</link>,
        as much as reasonable.
