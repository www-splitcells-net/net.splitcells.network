    <paragraph>
        Always use passwordless login.

    <paragraph>
        A command should be executed on a remote server via <quote>ssh [remote server] [command path]</quote>.
        Shell commands should be executed on a remote server via something like
        <quote>echo [script] | ssh [remote server] "/usr/bin/sh"</quote> in order to control,
        which shell is being used.
        Alternatively, use something like <quote>ssh [remote server] "/usr/bin/sh" &lt;&lt; EOF [script] EOF</quote>,
        when inline multi line scripts are considered.
