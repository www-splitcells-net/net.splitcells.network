        <title>The Generic Allocator Language - Geal</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>Geal is a minimal programming language for arbitrary program code
        with the main goal to describe programs for the Generic Allocator and therefore was named after it.
        The name Geal comes from using the first 2 letters for every word of the Generic Allocator,
        but Geal's full name is the Generic Allocator Language.
        Geal seem to also stand for
        <link url="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/geal">to congeal or stiffen</link>,
        which is quite fitting for a constraint language:
        an optimizer of a constraint problem takes the problem's variables with given value ranges and
        restricts the value ranges until a viable solution is found.
