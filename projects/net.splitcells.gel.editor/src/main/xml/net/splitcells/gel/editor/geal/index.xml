        <title>The Generic Allocator Language - Geal</title>
    </meta>
    <paragraph>Geal is a minimal programming language for arbitrary program code
        with the main goal to describe programs for the Generic Allocator and therefore was named after it.
        The name Geal comes from using the first 2 letters for every word of the Generic Allocator,
        but Geal's full name is the Generic Allocator Language.
        Geal seem to also stand for
        <link url="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/geal">to congeal or stiffen</link>,
        which is quite fitting for a constraint language:
        an optimizer of a constraint problem takes the problem's variables with given value ranges and
        restricts the value ranges until a viable solution is found.

        <title>Basic Grammar</title>
        <paragraph>The language basically consists of variable assignments,
            function calls, function call chains and method calls.
            Every action is a function call or a constant.
            A reference to a variable is the same as a function call without arguments and
            is implemented as such in the editor.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Modifiers are syntactic sugar, that allow one to remove the round brackets around function call arguments,
            if there is only one or none argument.
            This is demonstrated with the variables ending with <quote>_modified</quote> in the following example.

        <title>Language Usage</title>
        <paragraph>The goal of the language is to construct solution tables,
            that will be submitted to the optimizer,
            in order to find an optimal solution according to their constraints.
