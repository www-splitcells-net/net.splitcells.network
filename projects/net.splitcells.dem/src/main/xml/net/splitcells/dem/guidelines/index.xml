        <description>
            I created these code guidelines in order to do some thought
            experiments.
            Do not consider
            these code
            guide lines for
            your own
            code.

                <text>If you do, people will hate you, and you’ll be scorned by
                    friends and family.

            <d:todo>
                Every persistent task is part of a software project or a software
                project itself and should
                be
                contained inside a
                folder.
                <d:todo>A software project is metadata like the .git files of Git
                    repositories.
                    Another example are
                    the .idea folders of
                    Intellji IDE
                    projects.
                </d:todo>
                <d:todo>
                    If multiple software projects are added to the task folder,
                    it is
                    preferred to add software
                    projects to the task
                    folder. Wrapping the
                    task
                    folder
                    with software projects recursively does not
                    scale.
                    <d:todo>If possible one could create a software project folder
                        inside the folder
                        where all
                        software project files are
                        put. Make sure
                        to
                        make the folder name unique
                        i.e. ".meta.238" .
                    </d:todo>
                </d:todo>
            </d:todo>
            <d:todo>Make all assumtions visible (i.e. nullable variables via
                Optional).

        <title>Goals
        </title>
        <paragraph>These are my experimental code guidelines.
            These may
            not comply to common best
            practices and might be
            even harmful.
            They
            only
            represent the current state of some personal thought
            experiments.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            Do not consider these code guidelines for your own code.
            <link>
                <text>If you do, people will hate you, and you’ll be scorned by
                    friends and family.

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Guide lines are just that. They are nothing more and nothing less, but if these guidelines are
            not applied a reason should be present.
            These guide lines main goal is to set priorities and paradigms.
            The details should be handled by project or language specific guide lines.

        <title>Alternative Guidelines</title>
        <paragraph>For (programming) languages or parts of it without explicit guidelines, please use
            other public guidelines, as long it does not conflict with already
            implemented guides. Most accepted public guidelines are preferred.
        </paragraph>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Base Rule</title>
        <paragraph>The project structure, its contents and products has to represent a
            discovery based network of perspectives and changes.
            The project and its parts should be portable, extendable, adaptable,

        </paragraph>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Life Cycle</title>
        <paragraph>It should be known, why a project is created and under which conditions it will be dismantled.
        </paragraph>
        <chapter>
            <title>Version Control</title>
            <paragraph>The commit log is a program, that describes the development of the project.
                The
                <link>

                </link>
                is used as a default versioning format.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Make clear what is guaranteed and do this only via an explicit interface,
                that has no implementation specifics.
                Prefer backward compatible changes to backward incompatible changes.
                Make as much undefined as possible for not essential things in order to minimize the set of guarantees.
                Breaking other software, because it relied on implementation specifics is better,
                than breaking other software via incompatible API changes.
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>
        <chapter>
            <title>Development Process</title>
            <paragraph>The development process greatly influence the code and its format.
                Therefore some points regarding the development process that influence the code
                are included here as well.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Keep in mind that development is not just coding and it is affected by many different things.
                For example doing things always fast or slowly is propably not the best thing.
                Resources like documentation or the GUI may need to consider this.
                Do not assume that better skills, more intelligence, working harder, etc. automatically lead to a better
                result.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Minimize the size of the main backlog.
                Prefer smaller tasks over bigger tasks.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Priorize a working project state at every point in the development.
                Prefer test driven development.
                Ensure that the project is build, tested and executed in different environments,
                in order to ensure, that the projects works.
                This is called migration based development.

        <title>Management</title>
        <chapter>
            <title>Task Organization</title>
            <paragraph>
                Tickets should be stored at the location where these are
                used or matter. It should be
                easy to figure
                out
                which tickets apply to
                a certain portion of a project. If a person is working
                on a part of
                the
                project in question,
                relevant tickets should be available with
                little work.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Tickets with a low amount of content should
                be stored as a comment at the
                relevant source code
                location. Every task should start with <quote>TODO</quote>, which is recognized by many tools.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Use Eclipse like task tags followed by optional flowing text.
                Each paragraph stands for a ticket
                and may be divided by additional task
                tags into sub tickets. A description of the
                ticket is not required if the location of the tag makes
                the task obvious (i.e. RENAME tag above a variable declaration).
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Documentation</title>
        <paragraph>Documentation links syntax to semantics or represents meta data.
            A single point of entry should be provided from where every part of the documentation is reachable.
            Multiple points of additional entries may be provided.
            It should be possible to render all documentation as one site, were everything can be easily accessed
            and searched.
        </paragraph>
        <chapter>
            <title>Documentation Types</title>
            <paragraph>Manuals describe the implemented concept and how to use the described things.
                Thereby, all relevant words with special meaning have to be explained.
                This includes all words, that are used in implementation.
                The manual should not describe the API.
                For simplicity this should only consist of flowing structured text and inlines objects (i.e. images).
                In Java this is done via CommonMark files.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>API documentation describes all things that can be accessed legally.
                Implementation internals should not be noted here.
                In Java this is done via Javadoc.
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>
        <chapter>
            <title>Documentation Content</title>
            <paragraph>The documentation needs to at least define the goal or the result of the thing in question.
                Everything needs documentation.
                Classic documentation can sometimes be replaced by programs (i.e. build script named <quote>
                    build.service
                </quote> instead of
                describing how to
                build software), but everything needs documentation.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Documentation may also contain inspiration emotional content in the form of quotes
                and haiku and should always relate to the described thing.
                The additional emotional context provides a different perspective
                on the semantics of the documented thing.
                This helps the reader to better understand the project and its usage.
                The amount of such should be minimal.
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>
        <chapter>
            <title>Documentation Complexity Management</title>
            <paragraph>Updating the documentation is always a problem.
                Minimize the amount of documentation.
                In the best case, the name of a thing is its documentation.
                Documenting justifications may also be required in order to omit regressions
                or development things in a circle.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>If large documentation like a user manual is required, make it a project of its own.
                Otherwise, documentation and the software development will hinder each other,
                because of the combined complexity.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Every public API component should not only have a name/id but also have at least an naturally
                described
                summary of its functionality in order to merge syntax and semantics.
                This can be omitted if the name/id is also a natural description.
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Program Code</title>
        <paragraph>The programming code should prioritize adaptability and readability.
            This can be made by making it easy to refactor the code or to translate it to a completely other language.
            The use of standard/common code conventions also makes it easier to integrate other code easier
            and in a more consistent way.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Avoid side effects, as it makes it harder to understand a program.
            Avoid inheritance, because it makes it harder to write easily portable
            side effect free code under certain conditions.
            Inheritance works great as adhoc wrappers and type and implementation extenders.
            Inheritance does not support swapping out the parent implementation,
            which makes it often not portable in practice.
        </paragraph>
        <chapter>
            <title>Identifiers</title>
            <paragraph>Readability is preferred over compactness,

            <paragraph>This means a renaming

                while still maintaining the correct meaning.
                Symbols, whose meaning are already contained in other symbols,
                should be omitted.
                Names are preferred to abbreviation and abbreviation are preferred to symbols as a shorthand.

                An appropriate main method should be provided, so the tests can be executed as a program.
                This ensures that tests are nothing special and therefore independent of the build system.

                <paragraph>
                    Every test name starts with a verb like every other method that's primary function is an action.
                    Every test name should refer to the primarily tested thing (Object/Method/Function/Class),
                    the tested feature, the tested situation and the tested result in that order

                <paragraph>Inside tests following naming scheme can be used: a test subject is creating a test product
                    that is verified or validated in order to create a test result. A test is successful, if the test
                    result is positive.

                    Tests are generally speaking optional and not part of the
                    main
                    interface contract.
                    In other words no
                    code is allowed to rely on the fact, that it will be informed about
                    errors explicitly or implicitly.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>It has to be explicitly stated, if argument checking is
                    part of the interface. These types of checks are
                    not considered to
                    be

                required space is minimized and
                the readability and navigability of the text is maximized.
                Empty lines are omitted, if indentation is enough to easily separate code
                blocks.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Automatic code styling/formatting should never remove already present new line
                characters, as otherwise it is hard to structure large code statements.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>It is preferred that symbols that structure the code are located
                at the most left side instead at the most right side when whitespace is ignored.
                This allows the navigate the code structure easily while minimizing
                the need to look into the meaning of the code.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Prefer tabbing, if automatic source code formatting is preferred and details of the format are
                not important, in order to prefer writing speed.
                Prefer whitespace, if formatting details are important.

                Minimize dependency on concrete versions of the dependencies.
                Prefer own interfaces and avoid accessing external things. Use dependency injection via static methods
                as this supports
                most paradigms and implementations. This also supports
                dependency injection of general objects like lists nicely.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Minimize the number of extern dependencies that are explicitly supported as these can cause
                a maintenance burden. Minimize side effects between dependencies.
                For example, in an ideal case transitive dependencies are not shared between dependencies.

            <paragraph>If there are not enough resources or if it is not optimal to develop
                and maintain a piece of required functionality, then use a dependency in order to get this functionality
                and declare the functionality of the dependency as something that is out of scope of the project.
                The support, usage and extension of the dependency might still be part of the project.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Minimize direct dependencies between different things inside the project

                This makes
                it easier to
                create names for new things, to find new things by its name and to
                understand described things.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Use prefixes if multiple dictionaries have to be used in a

            <paragraph>Avoid importing the same things over and over again in

                that contain all
                imports and link
                to these dictionaries in each document. Minimize the
                number of dictionary documents
                which
                are linked to from a given

        <title>Complexity Management</title>

        <paragraph>
            The complexity of project should be planned.
            If the
            project's complexity becomes greater than planned, it
            may be a
            indicator that the project needs to be
            simplified.
            This can be done by
            splitting the project into multiple
            ones.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Minimize the amount of complexity.
            Minimize the set of required programming language features.
            The set of actually used programming features is not important.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>General code is easier to manage than domain specific functions
            as domain specific functions tend to grow in complexity over time.
            It is easier to limit the maximum complexity of general code, because its easier
            to exactly define the content of such a function.
            , that it relies on predefined interfaces, which may
            The downside of general code is, that it may provide more functionality
            than currently needed, which may require more code than strictly needed.
            This can be omitted by not implementing not used parts of the general code.
            There are 2 ways to do this: one can call a function with some arguments set to null,
            which are not valid, but are not used by the function because
            the other arguments are have certain values.
            Another way is to explicitly throw an exception, if a not implemented part is
            used. In this case it is best to create a dedicated exception class for this in order
            unambiguous mark unfinished code parts.
            Both methods create an exception, if an unfinished part of a code is executed.

            <paragraph>Complex projects consist of multiple projects called sub.
                A complex project is represented by a project called root.
                A sub project should be classifiable as on of 4 types: core, merger, sheath and environment.
                An merger project contains interfaces and abstract factories,
                An core project provides interface implementations and provide factories, that are used by the abstract
                factories of the merger project via dependency injection.
                Sheath code are explicit external dependencies of the project.
                Environment code are implicit dependencies of the root project

            Its purpose is to enforce a set of standard project formats, which all projects need to adhere.
            Thereby, the size build scripts in other projects is reduced.
            This leads to a situation, where for simple project formats
            the project format only needs to be declared.
