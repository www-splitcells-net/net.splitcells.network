	Keep in mind that the commands that will be executed next in a given stage, are largely determined by the return value of the previously executed commands' return values.
	Otherwise, more resources are used than necessary (i.e. system.update commands that require restarts).
	
	Each executed command should take a finite amount of time, as otherwise managed commands may not be executed correctly.
	(i.e. "system.update": if one update command waits for new updates, it is also blocking other update commands.
	It is preferred that each executed command takes up a small amount of time.
	
	TODO Currently the echo of executed commands are not filtered.
	This was attempted as this seems to be a useful in order to remove unnecessary information.
	If this feature is attempted again this should be develop in an own branch.
	Also this feature definitely requires testing.
	Another challenge is the output of color etc..
	Last time it was attempted colors were not present.
