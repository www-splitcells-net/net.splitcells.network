        <title>How to easily get the source code of a command.</title>
        <paragraph>
            Sometimes there is no command provided by OSI, that fits to ones needs.
            For instance, one might want to look at the operation systems logs and search for specific messages.
            One of the few commands provided in that regard is <quote>system.log.browser</quote>,
            but the user might not want to browse all log messages.
            Instead of looking the command up on the internet for specific things,
            one might want to just look up the shell commands of <quote>system.log.browser</quote>
            and adopt these quickly.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This can be done via <quote>cat $(which system.log.browser)</quote> on most shells.
            When executed, you can see the actual command executed for the task and
            use this command instead directly.
            Often enough the <quote>--help</quote> flag or the man pages can be helpful enough,
            to figure out, what needs to be changed.
            If this is not the case, the underlying command might help one,
            to easier find the desired solution online by using the underlying command for the search queries.
