# Manifesto
We want to install programs.
It does not interest us, whether the program is installed by PackageKit, dnf, apt, Flatpak, snap, a Windows installer, a bash script or something else.

We want to block network traffic of the system.
We do not want to activate the panic mode of Firewalld.

We want to declare our goals.
We do not want to have to provide secondary technical information beforehand without knowing where to look.

We want a common dictionary for common tasks.
We avoid remembering implementation specific commands for common tasks.

In most cases the operation system knows what to do.
If there is no real need to interfere with the defaults, we do not do it.

[So lets get started.](./manual/setup.md)
