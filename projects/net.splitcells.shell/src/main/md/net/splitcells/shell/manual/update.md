# Update Instructions
There are 2 options, in order to update or reinstall the program via the console.
Both can be executed at any location.

## First Option: Reinstall program and configure user's bin folder.
In order to just reinstall this program, one has to execute the following command in the console:
```sh
user.bin.configure.sh
```
This option is faster than the second.

## Second Option: Reapply All User Configurations
Generally it is recommended to reinstall this program and to reapply all user configurations during an update of this program:
```sh
user.configure
```
