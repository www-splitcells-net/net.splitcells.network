    <paragraph>
        The sub project Crisis Network (Cin) is the main playground in order to demonstrate and evaluate
        complex optimization systems.
        It is a game, that allows one to inject optimization problems into a shared world,
        in order to create a system with an enormous amount of complexity,
        thereby bringing the modelers and solvers to its limits and beyond.

        A game was chosen for this, in order to a have a concept on how to create and maintain a complex system,
        that still makes sense,
        when looked at by humans.
        There is not much more demotivating, than to optimize systems,
        that are complex and have no semantic meaning.
        A game also has a very high requirement for a good UI regarding the optimization software and
        therefore incentives one to not neglect the UI too much.
        At last, a game can be advertised to a larger audience,
        than optimization software.
