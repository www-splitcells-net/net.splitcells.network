    <paragraph>
        Only test simple or complex problems and their synchronization protocols.
        In general, do not test the content of problem networks exactly,
        as such test do not seem to be reliably and cost-effectively possible.
        On the other hand, tests that do simple statistics about a problem network seem to be fine.
