/**
 * <p>TODO Line index randomizer in order to test index calculations.</p>
 * <p>TODO IDEA Make Database easily and comfortable compatible to POJOs and
 * thereby make a type safe interface of {@link Database}</p>
 * <p>TODO IDEA PERFORMANCE A database should be implementable with a byte matrix as backend.
 * Such an performance optimization would make also sense,
 * if one needs to work on an instance of data (i.e. CSV files),
 * without creating copies or using caches.
 * Such an additional implementation could also be used,
 * in order to measure the performance impact of cache based system
 * and also the correctness of such a system.
 * Such a backend should support complex and dynamic types by using some
 * columns as index storages.
 * These indexes would point to a complex or dynamic object
 * in an appropriate additional storage.
 * In order to make this possible with a good performance the interface
 * needs to support primitive types without casting.</p>
 * <p>TODO Create a {@link Database} implementation with in-memory SQL backend (i.e. H2 database) as prerequisite,
 * for example, to GPU backed {@link Database} implementations.
 * This prerequisite would be a comparably easy undertaking compared to a GPU backed {@link Database},
 * because of the SQL language.
 * Therefore a SQL backed database could show problems,
 * that would be present for GPU backed {@link Database} as well,
 * which would be easier to tackle in the SQL context compared to the GPU context.
 * Keep in mind,
 * that it makes sense to create more than alternative implementations for {@link Database} in these cases,
 * as otherwise the performance increase is very limited.</p>
