/**
 * <p>When a {@link Rater} is implemented, one often has a choice,
 * to implement a simple {@link Rater} or a performant {@link Rater}.
 * A simple instance will calculate the {@link Rating} of all {@link Line} in a given group.
 * The performant one, will only calculate the changes in {@link Rating} of a given group and
 * the added or removed {@link Line}.</p>
 * <p>{@link Rater} implementations should always calculate the {@link Constraint#RESULTING_CONSTRAINT_GROUP}
 * based on the {@link Constraint#INCOMING_CONSTRAINT_GROUP}.
 * Avoid using caches or to store state in the {@link Rater} implementation if possible,
 * as this prone to errors.
 * For instance, caching {@link Constraint#INCOMING_CONSTRAINT_GROUP} and {@link Constraint#RESULTING_CONSTRAINT_GROUP}
 * can lead to accidental incorrect mappings between the 2.
 * Avoiding such a cache also avoids such mismatches as {@link #ratingAfterAddition(View, Line, List, View)}
 * provides info only for one {@link Constraint#INCOMING_CONSTRAINT_GROUP} at a time.</p>
 * <p>TODO RENAME Rater seems to be an incorrect name, because it produces more than a rating.</p>
 * <p>TODO For methods like {@link #ratingAfterAddition(View, Line, List, View)} use one dedicated type,
 * in order to make the method easy to extend.</p>
