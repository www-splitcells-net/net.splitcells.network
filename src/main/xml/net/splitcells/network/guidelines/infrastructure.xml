        <paragraph>If there are multiple projects, create a builder project.
            Its objective is to build all other projects.
            Its purpose is to enforce a set of standard project formats, which all projects need to adhere.
            Thereby, the size build scripts in other projects is reduced.
            This leads to a situation, where for simple project formats
            the project format only needs to be declared.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>All possible build and related tasks should be documented.
            One way is it to provide a command with no arguments for each task.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Builds should be regularly be done via all build systems
            used, in order to ensure that the code complies
            with each build
            system.
