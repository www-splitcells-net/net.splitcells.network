            <siteName/>'s Guidelines
        </title>
        <description>
            I created these code guidelines in order to do some thought
            experiments.
            Do not consider
            these code
            guide lines for
            your own
            code.

                <text>If you do, people will hate you, and you’ll be scorned by
                    friends and family.

                implementations. i.e.
                package.state(INSTALLED) -> package.install (Note that
                the first
                version makes more sense
                in some
                cases. The first one can also be

            <d:todo>
                Every persistent task is part of a software project or a software
                project itself and should
                be
                contained inside a
                folder.
                <d:todo>A software project is metadata like the .git files of Git
                    repositories.
                    Another example are
                    the .idea folders of
                    Intellji IDE
                    projects.
                </d:todo>
                <d:todo>
                    If multiple software projects are added to the task folder,
                    it is
                    preferred to add software
                    projects to the task
                    folder. Wrapping the
                    task
                    folder
                    with software projects recursively does not
                    scale.
                    <d:todo>If possible one could create a software project folder
                        inside the folder
                        where all
                        software project files are
                        put. Make sure
                        to
                        make the folder name unique
                        i.e. ".meta.238" .
                    </d:todo>
                </d:todo>
            </d:todo>
            <d:todo>Make all assumtions visible (i.e. nullable variables via
                Optional).

        <title>Goals</title>
        <paragraph>Guidelines are just that.
            They are nothing more and nothing less.
            If these guidelines are overridden a reason should be present,
            and be documented or commented, if it is feasible.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>For (programming) languages and document formats prefer
            using the most official or the most common guidelines,
            if there are no guidelines of this project applying to the
            aspect in question.
            In other words, language and documentation specific guidelines
            of this project try to only override public guidelines instead of
            writing complete custom guidelines from scratch.

    <chapter>
        <title>Base Rule</title>
        <paragraph>The project structure, its contents and products has to
            represent a discovery based network of perspectives and changes.
            The project and its parts should be portable, extendable, adaptable,

                </url>

            and comply with

            .
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This specifically means, that the file and
            content path of a particular information
            (for an XML element,
            this would be the file path + the XPath pointing to the XML element)
            should identify and describe or at least summarize the content's
            meaning.
            This also means, that in an ideal case, one should be able to guess,
            where to look, for a particular content without knowing where
            the files are located
