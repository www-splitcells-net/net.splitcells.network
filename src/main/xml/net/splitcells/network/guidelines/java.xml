        <title>Java Guidelines</title>
        <d:toDo>Prefer whitespace over spaces,
            because it is most portable and one has most control.

    <paragraph>Use only private or public visibility modifier.
        Method arguments are implicitly final.
        The source code has to comply with <quote>net.splitcells.dem</quote>'s Java grammar.
        Classes must not be final, because this is useful for <quote>net.splitcells.network.community.via.javadoc</quote>.

        <title>Java's Limitations</title>
        <paragraph>Here are problems encountered with Java listed and not solved.
            These should be considered, when an alternative language to Java is searched.

        <paragraph>There is no known way, in order to define a static API in Java in a similar portable, easy, performant and adaptable way,
            like C header files.
            The most portable way seems to be the usage of the service locator pattern and similar patterns,
            but the resulting code requires some non trivial boiler code.
