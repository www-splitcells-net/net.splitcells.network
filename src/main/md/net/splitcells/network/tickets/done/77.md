# Provide project overview in form of a network visualization.

Author: Mārtiņš Avots

Provides an overview of the project via a graph with non overlapping edges
in order to simplify structure.
Nodes are only connected with their most important neighbours.
Dashed lines symbolise connections which are not controlled by this project,
but which are present.

## Used Technology.

PlantUML is currently used for visualization, because it provides a way to
layout a network via relative positions of each node to each other, and it just
works. This [PlantUML Editor](https://plantuml-editor.kkeisuke.com/) is
currently used.

PlantUML seems to be pretty heavy and there does not seem to be client side
implementation for i.e. browsers. So, an alternative would be nice. Maybe plain
svg with a good template?
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) may be a good alternative.
