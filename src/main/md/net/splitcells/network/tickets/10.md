# Create minimal Java grammar for this project in order to make code less
complex.
* TODO: Make grammar clean, so it's straight forward to process for
  translations and to understand.
* TODO: Every grammar rule should represent only a meaning and not any
  technical grammar specific artifacts/rules.
* TODO: Detailed Javadoc grammar.
* TODO: Review grammar.
* TODO: Ensure that Java source code in Dem comply with this grammar,
  in order to be sure, that the grammar is at least somewhat battle tested.
  The grammar does not have to be valid for Java bootstrap code.
