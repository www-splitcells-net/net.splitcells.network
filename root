Not every project renderer should build its own transformer.\n- [ ] `ProjectRenderer.resources` should be based on projectRepository and not be given as an argument,\nin order to simplify standard layout configuration.\nIt is also currently used as a fallback file system, which is not the intended usage.\n- [ ] There should be not specific fallback renderer.\nInstead, all fitting renderers should be tried.\nAll fitting renderers should be sorted by their respective resourceRootPath.","files":null}]}
