Manage contributions, if project gets big.\n   1. TODO Create commands the execute each task.\n   1. TODO Add repo verification to optional CI process.\n   1. Based on signed pull requests.\n       1. Pull request has to be based on signed tag.\n   1. Proof identities.\n      1. Create script to create gpg key.\n      1. Implement script to create valid pull requests.\n      1. Implement script to check foreign pull requests.\n      1. Check presence of signatures automatically for the foreign parent commit of the merge via script.\n         Store public keys in this repositories, so that is trivial to check public keys to the signatures.\n         Note that this does not ensure that the commits are correct, because an attacker could change the public keys in the repository as well.\n         The public keys in this repository would therefore not be trustworthy.\n         Their primary goal is to ensure that the contribution process is adhered.\n         1. Trust a public key: https://yanhan.github.io/posts/2014-03-04-gpg-how-to-trust-imported-key.html\n         1. Create script that checks the signatures based on the keystore of the local user.\n            1. git tag | xargs git verify-tag\n         1. Create script that checks the signatures based on the public keys in this repo in order to check consistency.\n      1. Require upload of public keys via second channel.\n         1. Create a script for the upload.\n   1. Use and check https://developercertificate.org/.\n      1. DCO is better than CLA if one is sure that the license does not have to be changed.\n   1. Document this process so that other can reproduce it easily.\n   1. Helpful literature:\n       1.
