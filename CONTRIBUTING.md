## Notes

Signing by PGP or SSH key is not required.
Also, most open source projects do not do this and this does not seem to cause legal problems.
The [Linux Kernel](https://docs.kernel.org/process/maintainer-pgp-guide.html) does not sign commits and
instead focuses on verifying the developer communication instead.
Furthermore, all signature will be temporarily valid as well,
which reduces it usefulness in practice,
also it does not mean, that checking a repo regarding an expired key has not its use cases.
On the other hand, commit signing creates a huge burden and has no benefits, if it is not used properly.
Therefore, it is disregarded as a requirement.
