## API Compatibility
There is no guarantee of backwards compatibility.

Many API changes are located and categorized in the changelogs of the corresponding project.
Breaking changes are tried to be omitted, but there is no guarantee for that.

Absolute backward compatibility creates a maintenance burden,
but we do not break backward compatibility just for fun.

You can try to decrease the likelihood of breaking a certain feature,
by contributing an appropriate test case/suite for this feature.
Regardless of that, keep in mind, that there is no guarantee of backwards
compatibility.

TODO: Consider declaring backward compatibility a nice to have feature, instead of an absolute goal.
If backward compatibility is not guaranteed, an migration guideline should be provided.
Maybe via OpenRewrite for Java code?
The reasoning behind this is the maintenance burden without other relevant positive side effects.
